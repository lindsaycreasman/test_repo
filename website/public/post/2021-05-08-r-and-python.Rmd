R and python can be used interchangably with one another depending on the code and type of script. The reticulate package allows both of these systems to be used simultaneously.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
UT <- "Hook"
```

You can use the UT we created in the r script by labeling it as r.UT in python.
```{python}
UT = "'Em"
print(r.UT,UT)
```

You can use the UT created in python as py$UT in r.
```{r}
cat(c(UT,py$UT))
```
