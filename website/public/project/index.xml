INTRODUCTION I chose two datasets related to sports because sports are one of my main interests and one of my favorite statistics categories to study. Due to all the recent coaching changes at The University of Texas and other programs, I thought it would be interesting to study coaching salaries in college sports and study it alongside the number of wins a program had for the 2020 season.</description>

      <description>Introduction: The dataset, CFB2019, contains several categorical and numeric variables about the 2019 college football season.

This dataset also has the size of the stadium because I wanted to see if the potential to have more fans at games had any correlation on the number of wins a team had.</description>
